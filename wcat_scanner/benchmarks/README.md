  - [crawl-speed](#crawl-speed)

This folder consists of benches between different cases within the library and including comparison between other choices.

We only run benches of A11yWatch in this project.

The comparisons for the results on other projects come from our [github-actions](https://github.com/a11ywatch/github-actions/tree/main/.github/workflows) project.

## Overview

We have comparisons set against different languages and libs that can be used to crawl a web page.

## Benchmark Results

All benchmarks are done on 7gb linux machines with 2 cors. 
The linux builds run better than the mac builds due to IO differences and crawler memory backends.

#### crawl-speed (Small Website)

Case: `https://scanner.wcat.dev` multi site scan.
10x simultaneous runs each ran via localhost to avoid latency.
